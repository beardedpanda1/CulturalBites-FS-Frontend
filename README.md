# CulturalBites
This Frontend application is associated with the Cultural Bites Fullstack repository. There were a number of challeneges when incorporating mySQL, using Springboot, implementing functions within react. 

Some technical problems I've faced and still continue to face is implementing pathways correctly. This capstone was an immense learning opportunity for me due to it being my first expansive fullstack project. When looking into certain resources, I found that a lot of them used a previous version of Router which to a certain extent was problematic. Implementing correct syntax while achieving the result I've been striving for was an immense challenge. I hope to develop this application further beyond my time here at PerScholas.
